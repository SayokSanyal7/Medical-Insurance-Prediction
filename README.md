# Medical-Insurance-Prediction
* Developed a Medical Insurance Prediction model using Linear Regression to estimate insurance costs based on various factors.
* Acquired a dataset containing information on individuals, including age, BMI, smoking status, region, and medical charges.
* Conducted comprehensive data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
* Engineered features, handled categorical variables, and ensured data quality by addressing missing values and outliers.
* Utilized descriptive statistics and visualizations to gain insights into the distribution of medical charges and the relationships between variables.
* Employed the Scikit-Learn library to split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
* Implemented Linear Regression to create a predictive model for estimating medical insurance charges.
* Assessed the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Demonstrated proficiency in interpreting model coefficients and explaining the impact of different features on insurance charges.
* Emphasized the significance of the project in providing insights into factors influencing medical insurance costs.
